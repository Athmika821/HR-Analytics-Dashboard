# HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI

### Overview
This project uses a Kaggle HR dataset to explore employee attrition and performance patterns.  
The dashboard helps HR and leadership teams understand key factors behind employee turnover and engagement.

### Objective
To identify patterns that drive attrition and help build data-driven HR strategies.

### Data Source
Dataset: [Kaggle - HR Analytics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com)  
(Data includes demographics, job roles, satisfaction levels, and attrition status.)

### Key Insights
- **Attrition Rate:** Higher among younger employees with shorter tenures.  
- **Job Role Impact:** Sales and R&D show distinct attrition patterns.  
- **Performance Trends:** Work-life balance and overtime have strong correlation with attrition.  
- **Gender Analysis:** No significant bias, but work-life balance affects both genders equally.

### Tools Used
- Power BI (Dashboard, DAX, Power Query)  
- Excel (Initial Cleaning)  

### Deliverables
- `HR_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix` — interactive Power BI report
